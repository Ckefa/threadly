## Plans

### 8. Prioritized Implementation Order
**Phase 1 — Foundation (must-haves)**
1. Add `Slug` and `IsPublic` fields to Business model + slug generation on registration
2. Create `/b/{slug}` business profile page (public, no auth needed)
3. Create `/api/connect/{slug}` + OTP flow for self-registration
4. Update client auth to allow creating client records on-the-fly (not just pre-created by business)
5. Business share dashboard page with link + QR code
**Phase 2 — Discovery (nice-to-haves)**
6. Public business directory at `/businesses` with search
7. Categories/tags for filtering
8. Client sidebar search + "Discover" CTA
9. Location-based proximity search
**Phase 3 — Growth (growth-hacking)**
10. Email invites from business dashboard
11. Embeddable website widget
12. Social sharing buttons
13. Referral tracking

## Page-by-Page Improvements
### 1. Landing Page (`index.html`) — High Impact / Medium Effort
**Issues:** 1520-line monolith, no mobile nav, no demo/interactive elements, weak CTA hierarchy.
**Improvements:**
- **Split into header/hero/features/testimonials/pricing/cta/footer partials** — maintainable
- **Sticky nav** with transparent→solid scroll effect (glassmorphism)
- **Hero animation** — chat bubble typing animation (SVG/Lottie) instead of static icon
- **Feature section** — interactive preview cards that show chat mockups on hover (CSS-only transitions)
- **Testimonial carousel** — autoplay with dot nav, pull quotes with business avatars
- **Pricing toggles** — monthly/yearly with animated toggle
- **Scroll-triggered reveal** — fade-in-up on sections using IntersectionObserver (lightweight, no library)
- **Mobile hamburger** — slide-out menu with backdrop blur
- **Floating CTA** — "Start Free Trial" pinned bottom on mobile scroll
**Theme:** Dark teal hero gradient → warm white feature sections. Use the existing float/pulse animations but make them smoother.
---
2. Business Login & Register — Medium Impact / Low Effort
Issues: Plain forms, no visual feedback, no demo account hint, no brand personality.
Improvements:
- Animated background — gentle gradient mesh (teal→indigo) or subtle pattern overlay
- Card glassmorphism — frosted glass effect on the login card
- Password visibility toggle — eye icon in input
- "Remember me" checkbox — styled toggle
- Loading state — button shows spinner + "Signing in..." during POST
- Form validation — real-time email format check, min-length for password, inline error messages below fields not at top
- Register → Auto-login — After registration, auto-login and redirect to dashboard instead of requiring another login
- Demo credentials hint — subtle "Demo: demo@threadly.com / password" for quick testing
- Business type icons — on register, show a grid of clickable business type cards (automotive, salon, etc.) with icons, not a dropdown
Registration Flow Redesign:
Step 1: [Business Name] [Email]
Step 2: [Business Type] ← icon grid selection
Step 3: [Password] [Confirm Password] + strength meter
Progress bar at top, slide transitions between steps.
---
3. Business Dashboard — High Impact / Medium Effort
Issues: Dense layout, no data visualization, no quick-actions palette, no mobile support.
Improvements:
- Command Palette (Cmd+K) — modal overlay to search clients, navigate pages, create orders/bookings quickly. Like Linear/Slack quick switcher
- Widget-based layout — draggable cards for: Revenue (sparkline), Active Conversations (number + trend), Pending Orders (queue), Recent Activity (feed)
- Mini real-time stats — small animated counters for unread, pending, online clients
- Notification bell — dropdown with recent notifications (new client connected, order placed, booking requested)
- Client list search — filter-as-you-type input at top of sidebar
- Online indicators — green dot next to online clients, with "Online now (3)" summary
- Empty state — when no clients, show a friendly illustration with "Share your business link to get started" + quick link to share page
- Responsive sidebar — collapses to icon-only on medium screens, bottom nav on mobile
Currently the main business.html has no client search — the sidebar lists all clients with no way to filter. This is a major UX gap for businesses with many clients.
---
4. Business Chat — High Impact / High Effort
Issues: Polling-based (5s), no typing indicators, no rich messages, plain input.
Improvements:
- Typing indicator — "Client is typing..." with animated dots (CSS only, triggered by a lightweight endpoint)
- Smart suggestions bar — above input, show quick-action chips: "Send Order", "Book Appointment", "Request Payment" based on conversation context (inferred from business type)
- Message search — inside a conversation, search through message history
- Conversation sidebar — show last message preview, unread count, timestamp relative ("2m ago")
- Message status — Sent ✓, Delivered ✓✓, Read (blue double-check) — like WhatsApp
- Rich message actions — inline confirm/reject buttons on order cards without page reload
- Quick replies — business can save canned responses and insert with / commands
- Split view — right panel shows customer details (order history, booking history, notes) when clicking a customer info button
Currently: The chat_header.html has an "Analytics" button but the features it points to (Quotation, Payment, Goal) show "coming soon" notifications. Either implement them or remove the buttons.
---
5. Client Dashboard — Medium Impact / Low Effort
Issues: Basic list, no search, no visual differentiation between connected businesses.
Improvements:
- Business cards — richer cards with business type icon overlay, last message preview, time ago
- Search/filter — filter connected businesses by name or type
- Pin favorites — star icon to pin frequently used businesses to top
- Category badges — colored badges for business types (e.g., blue for dental, green for fitness)
- Empty state — "You haven't connected to any businesses yet" with illustration and "Find Businesses" CTA
- Business online status — green dot if the business has active sessions
---
6. Client Discover (client_discover.html) — Medium Impact / Low Effort
Issues: Plain list, no categories, no "already connected" visual, no business details.
Improvements:
- Category filter chips — horizontal scrollable chips at top: All, Automotive, Salon, Dental, etc. with icons
- Already connected badge — green "Connected" badge on businesses the client already has a conversation with, with "Open Chat" button instead of "Connect"
- Business cards redesign — card with subtle hover elevation, business type icon, star rating placeholder, location if available
- Infinite scroll — load more as user scrolls instead of showing everything at once
- Search with debounce — already implemented (300ms), but add search suggestions/history
- Results count — "Showing X of Y businesses"
---
7. Business Share Page — Low Impact / Low Effort
Issues: Already decent, but could be more engaging.
Improvements:
- Share analytics preview — "Your link has been viewed X times, Y clients connected"
- Social share buttons — WhatsApp, Twitter, Email share links (using the profile URL)
- QR download fix — current download uses canvas from cross-origin image which may fail; use fetch → blob → download instead
- Copy success animation — checkmark + "Copied!" toast instead of just changing icon
- Preview card — show a live preview of what the public profile looks like (iframe or mockup)
---
8. Client Login / OTP Pages — Medium Impact / Low Effort
Issues: OTP code is shown in UI (debug), no resend timer, no visual feedback.
Improvements:
- Remove OTP display — security risk, even in dev
- Resend timer — "Resend code in 0:30" countdown with clickable state after expiry
- Auto-submit OTP — as soon as 6 digits entered, auto-submit (already keyboard-friendly)
- Email validation — real-time email format check before allowing "Get OTP" click
- Animated transition — smooth slide from email entry to OTP entry
- Loading state — OTP input shows spinner while verifying
---
9. Public Profile (public_profile.html) — Medium Impact / Medium Effort
Issues: Sparse, no social proof, no booking widget.
Improvements:
- Online indicator — Show if the business is active/accepting clients
- Business hours — display hours if available
- Quick preview cards — show top 3 services with price, or all products
- Direct connect card — always-visible CTA card that follows on scroll
- Review/Rating placeholder — structure for future reviews
- Share buttons — share this business on social media
---
Global System Improvements
Design System (Medium Effort, High Impact)
- Create a tailwind.config.js with custom tokens (brand colors won't work via CDN — need proper config)
- Or use CSS custom properties in a single styles.css file to define the design tokens
- Build reusable component classes with @apply directives
Animation System (Low Effort, High Impact)
- Page transitions — fade between pages using CSS view transitions (Chrome 111+)
- List animations — staggered fade-in for lists (clients, messages)
- Micro-interactions — button press (scale 0.97), card hover (slight elevation), smooth sidebar collapse
- Toast redesign — slide-in from top-right with progress bar for auto-dismiss, stackable
Loading States (Low Effort, High Impact)
- Skeleton screens — for chat loading, dashboard stats, client lists instead of full-page spinners
- HTMX indicators — use htmx-indicator class to show spinners on buttons during requests (already available but not used)
- Progress bar — thin top-of-page progress bar for navigation (like YouTube)
Empty States (Low Effort, Medium Impact)
- Every list view needs a thoughtful empty state: illustration + message + CTA
- Examples: No clients → "Share your link", No messages → "Send your first message", No orders → "Create an order"
Responsive Design (Medium Effort, High Impact)
- Current layouts break below ~1024px
- Mobile approach: Bottom nav bar for business/client, slide-out drawers for sidebar, full-width chat
- Breakpoint targets: desktop (1280+), tablet (768-1279), mobile (<768)
